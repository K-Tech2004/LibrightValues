<h2>What is LibrightValues?</h2>
    <p>LibrightValues is in essence an 8values style test for ideologies which stem from classical liberal thought, including Right-Libertarianism and Fiscal Conservatism. Remember you don't have to lie on this test, and that each questions only affects one axis.<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the eight values?</h2>
    <p>There are 3 independent axes on this axes; Radicality, Cultural and Alignment - each one of them with 2 opposing values assigned. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Moderation</b> (Radicality)<br/>"
        While those with higher moderation scores still fundamentally believe in the classical liberal ideals of "Life, Liberty and Property" they believe that these ideas shouldn't be taken too far, especially beyond the means of whatever was "tried and tested" in the past decades. They also aren't as skeptical of the state as an institution, going as far as to see it as not an evil but rather a good for liberty. They tend to support support neo-classical economics, strictly keeping activism within the law and other similair policies.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Extremity</b> (Radicality)<br/>
        Those with higher extremity scores not only believe in classical liberal ideals of old, they want to take them beyond the span of the original movement. They are very skeptical of the state, seeing it as either a necessary or an unecessary evil. They tend to support Austrian school thought, counter-economic activity and other similar policies.  </p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Libertarian Unity</b> (Alignment)<br/>
        Those with higher Libertarian Unity scores believe that the traditional pro-government right is not to be trusted for co-operation, and that the alliance with left-libertarian movements would be more justified. They tend to be more lenient on economics and democracy and less lenient on strict civil liberty</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Authority</b> (Alignment)<br/>
        Those with higher Right Unity scores believe that left-libertarian movements which they don't see as very libertarian in the first place are not to be trust for co-operation, and that the alliance with a statist right would be more beneficial. They to more lenient on monarchism, foreign intervention and less lenient on economics.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Paleo</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        Those with higher Paleo believe that cultural heritage is integral for a society to function and be free. They tend to favour traditional institutions like the church and family and tend to be skeptical of things like woke culture.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Bleeding Heart</b> (Cultural)<br/>
        Those with higher bleeding-heart scores tend to believe that a free society should not only be legally unrestricted, but also culturally. Supporting skepticism towards traditional institutions and believing in a culture of inclusivity.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the librightvalues, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send us an email at eightvalues@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
